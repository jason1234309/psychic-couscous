## Tools README 

# Tools

This directory contains scripts that generate information from the benchmarks contained in the original benchmark directory

# contents
cell_information_gen.tcl:

    * This is a tcl script that goes into the provided benchmark and creates a .csv file that contains most of the information of all the cells in the design.
    * The information found in the .csv files are 
        + Cell Name
        + Cell Type
        + Tile name
        + Tile Type
        + Site name
        + Site Type
        + Site Type Used by the Cell
        + Alternate Site Types

compile_bencmark.tcl:

    * This is a tcl script used to compile a system verilog design without using the vivado gui
    * This script will do synthesis, placing, routing, and generate the bitstream without use of the vivado gui

create_cell_information_dir.sh:

    * This is a bash script that manages the file management for the cell_information_gen.tcl script
    * This script goes into every directory in the current directory and checks to see if the directory has a original_design directory
    * If the directory has a original_design directory, next it will go into the original_design directory and run the cell_information_gen.tcl script through vivado -mode batch command.
    * This script will follow those steps for all directories in the current directory and will move all the output files into a common directory named cell_information_csvs and will place the new directory into the current directory

create_tiletype_dir.sh:

    * This is a bash script that manages the file management for the tiletypes.tcl script
    * This script goes into every directory in the current directory and checks to see if the directory has a original_design directory
    * If the directory has a original_design directory, next it will go into the original_design directory and run the tiletypes.tcl script through vivado -mode batch command.
    * This script will follow those steps for all directories in the current directory and will move all the output files into a common directory named tile_type_lists and will place the new directory into the current directory

tiletypes.tcl:

    *This is a tcl script that goes into the provided benchmark and creates a .lst file that contains most of the information and the hardware components used by the design
    *The .lst output file contains several lists of different hardware components including
        + list of all the cells
        + list of all the sites
        + list of all the site types and alternate site types
        + the site used for each cell
        + list of all the tiles
        + list of all the tile types
    *This file gives similar information as cell_information_gen.tcl, but this script gives the output into a text file instead of the .csv format

tile_types_bench_database_gen.py:

    * This is a python script that reads all the .csv files in the current directory and generates a csv file that contains the tile types used by each benchmark contained in the current directory
    * It starts by parsing through all the .csv files and creates a header with all the unique tile types found in all the benchmark csv files
    * The next step is that it parses through the .csv files and creates the row data for the csv table
    * The last step is that the python script creates a new csv file and puts the header and row data into the file.
    * the new file should be called tile_database.csv
    * There is a issue where if there is a .csv file that does not contain a ' Tile Type' column the script will stop with an error, but this should not be a problem if the only csv files in the current directory are the ones generated by the create_cell_information_dir.sh
